# Contributors File

The process of editing the website's content is partly manual and partly automated. To get started, read through the full workflow on the page below.

[Mechanics of Making Changes](./mechanics.md)
- [Locate the files](./mechanics.md#where-can-i-find-the-content)
- [Edit the files](./mechanics.md#how-can-i-edit-the-content)
    - [Edit online via GitHub](./mechanics.md#option-1-github)
    - [Edit locally via git](./mechanics.md#option-2-local-git)
- [Validate your changes](./mechanics.md#validating-your-changes)

With the overall process in mind, dig into the details of how to rewrite and format the information you're updating. These formatting guidelines are tested and must pass validation in an automated process before the new data is published to the website.
